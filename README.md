# Free Online Voting Platform

This project implements a digital polling station by using a simplified form of a blockchain.

The key feature is to seperate the voter from the voting itself, so it can stay completely anonymous, but still authentic.

Technology stack is: HTML, CSS and JavaScript (NodeJS, Express, SQLlite, JQuery and D3)
